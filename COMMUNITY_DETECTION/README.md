# Community Detection in Social Networks

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for my research paper titled "Community Detection in Social Networks using CPM (Clique Percolation Method), Louvain, and LPA Algorithms." The study focuses on applying three popular community detection algorithms to identify cohesive communities within social networks and analyze their properties.

## Key Features:

Implementation of CPM (Clique Percolation Method): The repository includes a Python implementation of the CPM algorithm for community detection. The CPM algorithm detects communities based on the formation of k-cliques and the percolation of these cliques to form larger cohesive communities.

Implementation of Louvain: It also provides a Python implementation of the Louvain algorithm, a fast and scalable method for community detection in large-scale social networks. The code leverages graph partitioning techniques to identify communities with high modularity.

Implementation of LPA (Label Propagation Algorithm): The repository includes a Python implementation of the Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) for community detection. The LPA algorithm propagates labels through the network based on the connectivity and similarity of nodes, identifying communities through label consensus.

## Result, Conclusion, and Future Work:
In addition to the code implementations, the repository also includes the result, conclusion, and future work sections of the research paper. These sections provide an overview of the experimental findings, insights drawn from the study, and suggestions for further research in the field of community detection in social networks.

## Usage and Documentation:
The repository provides detailed instructions on how to use the implemented algorithms for community detection in social networks. It includes documentation that describes the input data format, the parameters to be set, and the output generated by each algorithm. Users can follow the provided guidelines to apply the algorithms to their own social network datasets.

## Future Updates:
I plan to continuously update this repository with improvements and additional features. This may include optimizing the algorithms for performance, incorporating new community detection methods, or expanding the documentation to provide more comprehensive usage instructions and examples.
